      <p>
        Thank you for purchasing from 51.784.170 PEDRO HENRIQUE FERNANDES DE CAMPOS. We hope you are satisfied with our services,
        but we understand that sometimes things don’t work out as expected. This Refund Policy explains how you can request a refund
        if you are not fully satisfied.
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Period</h2>
      <p>
        After your purchase, you have 180 days from the moment your order or service confirmation is delivered to you
        to request a refund. If you are not fully satisfied with your investment, you can
        easily ask for your money back within this period.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> We encourage all our customers to use our services for a reasonable period of time
        to experience the expected results before reaching a conclusion. However, we respect your decision
        if you wish to request a refund earlier.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make sure you are still within the 180-day period starting from the day the service was confirmed
          or the product was delivered to you. If you need to verify the delivery or confirmation date, please check the information
          provided in your email or receipt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Send an email to our support team at
          <a href="mailto:contato@pedrohenriquecampos.com.br">contato@pedrohenriquecampos.com.br</a> with the
          subject line “Refund Request,” clearly stating that you are requesting a refund and including your full name,
          order number and contact details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once your Refund Request is reviewed and approved, our support team will provide instructions
          on how to return any documents or materials related to the service, if applicable. The return address is:

        </li>
        <li>
          All shipping costs for returning any physical materials are the responsibility of the customer, when applicable. We will
          initiate the refund as soon as we receive and verify the returned items or confirm the cancellation of the service.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Processing Time</h2>
      <p>
        Once we receive your request and, when applicable, the returned items, we will inspect them to ensure eligibility. If approved,
        refunds typically take between 5–10 business days to be credited back to your original payment
        method, depending on your financial institution.
